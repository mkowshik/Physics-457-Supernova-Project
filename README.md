# Physics-457-Supernova-Project


README


Alright! So you made it to my github repository where I am storing all my code and data. I thought this was the most efficient way to present my code. See the README from Canvas for the important links. I'll put them here for convenience. 


Github repository =  https://github.com/mkowshik/Physics-457-Supernova-Project

Final source code = http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mkowshik/Physics-457-Supernova-Project/blob/master/Final%20Source%20code.ipynb

Final plots = http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mkowshik/Physics-457-Supernova-Project/blob/master/Plots.ipynb


In the “Source Code” folder, there is the source code I used to analyze everything. They are in the format “.ipynb” (which allows me to share it online) so I also uploaded “.py” files if you wanted run it for yourself. To save myself in case of computer failure, I saved each calculated dataset to a CSV file in “Final Source code.ipynb” and then did all the plotting manipulations in “Plots.ipynb”. If you look at the final source code, you should be able follow it pretty well.

Let me know if you have any questions.
