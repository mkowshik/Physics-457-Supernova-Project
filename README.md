README


Alright! So you made it to my github repository where I am storing all my code and data. I thought this was the most efficient way to present my code. See the README from Canvas for the important links. I'll put them here for convenience. 




The file "Final Source code.ipynb" is the code I used to calculate all the data I used to create the likelihood distributions.

To save myself in case of computer failure, I saved each calculated dataset to a CSV file and then did all the plotting manipulations in Plots.ipynb. You will see all the datasets in the "My Data" folder.
