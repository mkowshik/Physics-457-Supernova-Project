README


Alright! So you made it to my github repository where I am storing all my code and data. I thought this was the most efficient way to present my code.

The file "Final Source code.ipynb" is the code I used to calculate all the data I used to create the likelihood distributions.

To save myself in case of computer failure, I saved each calculated dataset to a CSV file and then did all the plotting manipulations in Plots.ipynb. You will see all the datasets in the "My Data" folder.
